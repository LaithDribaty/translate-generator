# translate-generator

This is a script which uses transformer to transcribe german audio to text which will be translated using another model to have srt file for each mp4 file in the current directory.

Install the translator first and whisper `small` model.

## Result:

Check `One Piece` series translated using the script (english + german) so that learning can be facilitated.
